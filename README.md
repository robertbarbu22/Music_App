The application seeks to enhance the userâ€™s music-listening experience by creating
an interactive environment that offers personalized recommendations. Often, users are
overwhelmed by the multitude of available music options, and an application that helps
discover new songs through various functionalities and games can be a modern approach

Furthermore, most users of music platforms use Spotify for music streaming. Integrating
Spotify APIs facilitates authentication and allows for easy synchronization with
Spotify for the MoreThanMusic application, without requiring users to give up an application
they are already familiar with and where they have existing playlists and songs
added to their favorites.
